# The BooksCorpus dataset has 1033957426 examples
# (for a total of 1033957938 tokens), which means there are
# about ~1b tokens per epoch. GPT-1 was trained
# for 100 epochs on a minibatch size of 64. Each epoch
# was therefore approximately 16m steps at batch size of 64. At
# a batch size of 64, with a context length of 512, there are about
# 32k tokens per step on a single node. For our case, we have access
# to a 1xA100 instance, so we will train with a batch size
# of 12 (to fit into memory) and use gradient accumulation with 5 steps
# to approximate the batch size of 64. In order to replicate 1b tokens per epoch,
# 1 epoch at these settings would equal ~160k steps. Let's train for 10 epochs,
# so we will train for a total of 1.6m steps.
